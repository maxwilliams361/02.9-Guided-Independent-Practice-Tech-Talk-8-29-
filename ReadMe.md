# 02.9 Guided/Independent Practice (SOLUTION CODE)

Let's spruce up this webpage by adding borders, padding, and margin to different HTML elements. 

## Code Along Part 1 (Border)

1. I want the title of the webpage ("Wildlife Photography") to pop out more so let me add a border to it. If I want to change the title of the webpage in CSS, what should be my selector?

Now watch as I add `5px` black solid border in CSS. (Pop it out in full screen to see the full effect).

2. The images could use some border styling too! In CSS, add a border to ALL images that is `5px`, solid, and yellow

Want to get fancy? Instead of making the border `solid` try `dashed`, `dotted`, or `inset`.

## Code It Solo Part 2 (Padding and Margin)
3. Let's make it so that the border does not touch the image. Try adding `5px` of `padding` to ALL the images on the pages.

4. The pics are too close to each. Try adding  `5px` of `margin` so they're more spread out. 


## Code Along Part 2 (Styling Divs)
5. We just talked about how <divs> allow us to make separate sections in our website. Taking a look at the HTML, what separate sections do we have on this webpage? 

Let's erase the border we put around the `h1` and put it around the  `<div>` with the class of `header` instead. Just to make it pop even more, let's also give the `header` div a `background-color` of yellow.

6. Apply a border (you can choose the color), padding, margin to the content inside the  `div` with the class of `description` (check out lines 24-26). Remember: you'll have to use a class selector here!
